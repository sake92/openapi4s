# openapi4s

OpenApi generators for Scala.

## Features and Benefits
- incremental generator
  - doesn't touch the code that you added manually
  - only adds new properties/methods/classes
- lenient parser+generator
  - if something is not supported it will still (mostly) work
  - you can adapt your openapi spec to work gradually

## Limitations
- JSON only
- only *named* entities, no anonymous objects
